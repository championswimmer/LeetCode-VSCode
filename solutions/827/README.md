**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `componentMap`: A map to store the size of each connected component (island) found. The key is a unique `componentId`, and the value is the size of that component.
   - `seen`: A set to keep track of visited cells during the Depth First Search (DFS).

2. **DFS Exploration (`dfs` function):**
   - The `dfs` function takes the cell coordinates (`i`, `j`) and the current `componentId` as input.
   - **Base Cases:** It first checks for invalid conditions: going out of bounds, encountering water (0), or visiting an already processed cell. In these cases, it returns 0.
   - **Marking Visited and Assigning Component:** If valid, it marks the current cell as visited (`seen`) and assigns it the current `componentId`.
   - **Recursive Exploration:** It recursively calls itself for all four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), adding 1 (for the current cell) to the sum of the sizes returned from each recursive call.

3. **Identifying and Sizing Islands:**
   - The code iterates through the grid.
   - For each cell containing land (1) that hasn't been visited:
     - It assigns a new `componentId` and calls `dfs` to explore and mark the connected component. 
     - The size returned by `dfs` is stored in the `componentMap` along with the `componentId`.

4. **Finding Potential Merging Points and Calculating Max Area:**
   - The code iterates through the grid again.
   - This time, it focuses on cells containing water (0), as these are potential merging points.
   - For each '0' cell:
     - It creates a `seenComponents` set to prevent counting the same component multiple times.
     - It initializes `area` to 1 (representing the '0' that could become a '1').
     - It checks adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) for their `componentId` (which would be different from 0 if they are part of an island) and adds them to the `seenComponents` set.
     - It calculates the total `area` achievable by merging the '0' with its neighboring components using the sizes stored in `componentMap`.
     - It updates `maxArea` if the current `area` is larger.

5. **Handling All '1's or Empty Grid:**
   - Finally, the code checks if `maxArea` is still 0, indicating that either the entire grid was '1's or it was empty. In this case, it returns the total size of the grid. 

**In essence, the code first identifies and measures all existing islands. Then, it strategically evaluates each '0' cell to determine the largest possible island that can be formed by converting that '0' to a '1' and merging it with its neighboring islands.**
