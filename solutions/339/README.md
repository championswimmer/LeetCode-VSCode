Certainly! Let's break down the code for the "Nested List Weight Sum" problem:

1. The problem deals with a nested list structure, where each element can be either an integer or another nested list.

2. The `depthSum` function is the main function that solves the problem. It takes two parameters:
   - `nestedList`: The input nested list
   - `depth`: The current depth (default is 1 for the top level)

3. The function initializes a variable `sum` to keep track of the weighted sum.

4. It then iterates through each element (`elem`) in the `nestedList`:

   - If the element is an integer (checked using `elem.isInteger()`):
     - It adds the product of the integer value (`elem.getInteger()`) and the current depth to the sum.

   - If the element is a nested list:
     - It recursively calls `depthSum` on the nested list (`elem.getList()`), incrementing the depth by 1.
     - The result of this recursive call is added to the sum.

5. After processing all elements, the function returns the total sum.

The key aspects of this solution are:

- Recursion: It uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth.
- Depth tracking: It keeps track of the depth and uses it to weight the integers accordingly.
- Interface usage: It uses the provided `NestedInteger` interface methods like `isInteger()`, `getInteger()`, and `getList()` to interact with the nested structure.

This solution effectively calculates the weighted sum where each integer's weight is determined by its depth in the nested structure.
