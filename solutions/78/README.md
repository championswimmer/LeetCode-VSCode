Certainly! Let's go through the code and explain it with a dry run using the example input `[1, 2, 3]`.

The `subsets` function takes an array `nums` as input and returns all possible subsets of that array.

Here's how the code works:

1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store all subsets.
2. Add an empty subset `[]` to `result` as the first subset.
3. Iterate through each number in the input array `nums`.
4. For each number, create new subsets by adding the current number to all existing subsets in `result`.

Let's do a dry run with `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:

1. Initialize: `result = [[]]`

2. First iteration (i = 0, nums[i] = 1):
   - Current `result` length: 1
   - New subsets: `[1]`
   - `result = [[], [1]]`

3. Second iteration (i = 1, nums[i] = 2):
   - Current `result` length: 2
   - New subsets: `[2], [1,2]`
   - `result = [[], [1], [2], [1,2]]`

4. Third iteration (i = 2, nums[i] = 3):
   - Current `result` length: 4
   - New subsets: `[3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]`
   - `result = [[], [1], [2], [1,2], [3], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]`

5. Return `result`

The key idea is that in each iteration, we double the number of subsets by adding the current number to all existing subsets.

The line `result.push([...result[j], nums[i]])` creates a new subset by spreading the elements of an existing subset and adding the current number to it.

This approach ensures that we generate all possible subsets without duplicates and in a systematic way.

Time Complexity: O(2^n), where n is the length of the input array.
Space Complexity: O(2^n) to store all subsets.

This solution is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good approach for the subset generation problem.
