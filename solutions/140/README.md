# Prompt 1: Explain 

Certainly! This code is a solution to the LeetCode problem "140. Word Break II". Let's break it down:

1. The function `wordBreak` takes two parameters:
   - `s`: the input string to be broken into words
   - `wordDict`: an array of valid words

2. It initializes an empty array `sentences` to store the valid sentence combinations.

3. The function uses a recursive approach to break down the string:

   - It iterates through the string, considering all possible prefixes (from 1 to the length of the string).
   
   - For each prefix (`word`), it checks if it's in the `wordDict`.
   
   - If the word is found in the dictionary:
     
     a. If it's the entire string (`i === s.length`), it adds this word to the `sentences` array.
     
     b. Otherwise, it recursively calls `wordBreak` on the remaining part of the string (`s.substring(i)`).
     
     c. For each valid sentence returned from the recursive call, it prepends the current word and adds it to the `sentences` array.

4. Finally, it returns the `sentences` array containing all valid combinations.

The recursive nature of this solution allows it to explore all possible ways to break the string into valid words from the dictionary. Each recursive call handles a smaller substring, and the results are combined to form complete sentences.

This solution has a time complexity that can be exponential in the worst case, as it explores all possible combinations. It might not be efficient for very long strings or large dictionaries, but it correctly solves the problem for most inputs.

# Prompt 2: Explain + Dry Run 

Certainly! Let's explain the code and then dry run it with an example.

Explanation:

1. The function `wordBreak` takes a string `s` and an array of words `wordDict`.
2. It initializes an empty array `sentences` to store valid sentence combinations.
3. It iterates through the string, considering all possible prefixes.
4. For each prefix, it checks if it's in the `wordDict`.
5. If the prefix is a valid word:
   - If it's the entire string, it adds it to `sentences`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls `wordBreak` on the remaining part of the string.
   - It then combines the current word with each sentence from the recursive call.
6. Finally, it returns all valid sentence combinations.

Let's dry run this with an example:

Input:
s = "catsanddog"
wordDict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"]

Dry run:

1. Start with "catsanddog"
   - Check "c" - not in dict
   - Check "ca" - not in dict
   - Check "cat" - in dict
     Recursive call with "sanddog"
     
     1.1 "sanddog"
         - Check "s" - not in dict
         - Check "sa" - not in dict
         - Check "san" - not in dict
         - Check "sand" - in dict
           Recursive call with "dog"
           
           1.1.1 "dog"
                 - Check "d" - not in dict
                 - Check "do" - not in dict
                 - Check "dog" - in dict
                 Add "dog" to sentences
           
           Combine "sand" with "dog" -> "sand dog"
         
     Combine "cat" with "sand dog" -> "cat sand dog"

   - Check "cats" - in dict
     Recursive call with "anddog"
     
     1.2 "anddog"
         - Check "a" - not in dict
         - Check "an" - not in dict
         - Check "and" - in dict
           Recursive call with "dog"
           
           1.2.1 "dog"
                 (Same as 1.1.1)
                 Add "dog" to sentences
           
           Combine "and" with "dog" -> "and dog"
         
     Combine "cats" with "and dog" -> "cats and dog"

2. Return sentences: ["cat sand dog", "cats and dog"]

This dry run demonstrates how the function recursively breaks down the string, explores all valid combinations, and builds up the sentences.
