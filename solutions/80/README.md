Certainly! Let's break down the code and explain how it solves the problem of removing duplicates from a sorted array while allowing each unique element to appear at most twice:

```javascript
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    let resI = 0;
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (resI < 2 || num > nums[resI - 2]) {
            nums[resI] = num;
            resI++;
        }
    }
    return resI;
};
```

1. We initialize a variable `resI` to 0. This variable will keep track of the index where we should place the next valid element in the modified array.

2. We iterate through each number `num` in the input array `nums`.

3. For each `num`, we check two conditions:
   a. `resI < 2`: This allows the first two elements to be added without any checks.
   b. `num > nums[resI - 2]`: This checks if the current number is greater than the element two positions before in the modified array.

4. If either of these conditions is true, we:
   a. Place the current `num` at index `resI` in the array.
   b. Increment `resI` to move to the next position.

5. If neither condition is true, we skip the current number (effectively removing it).

6. After processing all numbers, we return `resI`, which represents the length of the modified array.

The key idea here is that we're maintaining a "window" of two elements. We only add a new element if it's different from the element two positions before it. This ensures that each unique element appears at most twice in the final array.

This solution modifies the array in-place and uses O(1) extra memory, meeting the problem's requirements. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, as we iterate through the array once.
