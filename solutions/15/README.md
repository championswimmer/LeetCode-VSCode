Certainly! Let's break down the code and explain its functionality:

1. The `threeSum` function takes an array of numbers (`nums`) as input and aims to find all unique triplets that sum up to zero.

2. Inside `threeSum`, there's a helper function called `twoSum`. This function finds pairs of numbers in a sorted array that sum up to a given target `k`.

3. The main algorithm starts by sorting the input array `nums` in ascending order.

4. The code then iterates through each number in the sorted array:
   - It skips duplicate numbers to avoid duplicate triplets.
   - For each number, it calls `twoSum` on the remaining portion of the array, looking for pairs that sum up to the negation of the current number.

5. The `twoSum` function uses a two-pointer approach:
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers at the start and end of the array.
   - It moves these pointers inward, comparing the sum of the numbers at these positions with the target `k`.
   - If a match is found, it's added to the result, and the pointers are moved while skipping duplicates.

6. The results from `twoSum` are combined with the current number to form triplets, which are then added to the final result.

7. The function returns all unique triplets that sum to zero.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array. The sorting step takes O(n log n), and the nested loops (the outer loop in `threeSum` and the while loop in `twoSum`) contribute O(n^2).

The use of sorting and the two-pointer technique in `twoSum` allows for efficient handling of duplicates and reduces the overall time complexity compared to a naive approach.
