# Explanation (Recursive, with Claude)

Certainly! Let's break down the code for the Regular Expression Matching problem:

1. The function `isMatch(s: string, p: string): boolean` takes two parameters:
   - `s`: The input string to match against
   - `p`: The pattern to match with

2. The base cases are handled first:
   - If `p` is equal to `s` or `p` is '.*', it returns `true` as these patterns match any string.

3. `firstMatch` checks if the first characters of `s` and `p` match:
   - It ensures `s` is not empty and checks if the first characters are the same or if `p[0]` is '.'.

4. The main logic is divided into two cases:

   Case 1: If `p` has at least 2 characters and the second character is '*':
   - It checks for two possibilities:
     a. `zeroMatch`: The '*' matches zero occurrences of the preceding character, so we skip the first two characters of `p` and try to match the rest.
     b. `oneMatch`: The '*' matches one or more occurrences, so we check if the first character matches and then recursively match the rest of `s` with the same pattern.
   - It returns `true` if either `zeroMatch` or `oneMatch` is true.

   Case 2: If the second character is not '*' or `p` has less than 2 characters:
   - It checks if the first characters match and recursively checks the rest of the strings.

5. The function uses recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems, checking different possibilities of matching.

This solution uses a recursive approach to handle the different cases of pattern matching, including the special characters '.' and '*'. It explores all possible ways the pattern can match the string, making it a comprehensive but potentially time-consuming solution for large inputs.
